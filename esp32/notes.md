First attempt with the ESP32. As of writing, not connected to the LED strip yet, but it works on the local wifi (and wired office network). (Note the replaced passwords and names in the sign.yml in this directory).

Also note, that these Docker based scripts cannot be used on a NFS based directory, so not over the NAS, home directory, etc.
